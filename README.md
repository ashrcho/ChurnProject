### üìñ Context 
#### <ins>Churn<ins>
Churn or churn rate according to Investopedia is the "**rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity.**" Understanding how churn affects your business is crucial. Good customer retention strategy starts with understanding: 
- Why customers are leaving
- Which types of customers are leaving
- And at what rate they're leaving

To drive the point further, without a thorough understanding of KPI metrics like Churn Rate you are effectively flying blind. Insights provided via data are the eyes and ears of a business. It only becomes possible to solve and understand a problem by becoming aware of its existance and depth. Current machine learning models provide us useful tools that help us in this endeavor of problem solving/analysis.
